	- Can we conquer data chaos with these classic algorithms? This project delves into the practical implementation of linear and search algorithms in C

## Concepts Tested
	- C Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing two fundamental search algorithms in C: linear search and binary search. You'll gain practical experience with these algorithms and understand their time and space complexity.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement linear and binary search algorithms in C
- Explain the concepts of search algorithms, including linear search and binary search.
- Analyze the time complexity (worst-case) of linear and binary search
- Analyze the space complexity (worst-case) of linear and binary search.
- Compare and contrast the performance of linear and binary search based on their complexity.
- Understand the Big O notation for expressing algorithmic complexity.
